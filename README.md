# Python Algorithms

## Overview
Algorithms are the fundamental building blocks of programming, forming the backbone of the software we use dailyâ€”whether in spreadsheets, social networks, or AI-powered applications. By understanding algorithms, you gain a systematic approach to solving programming challenges efficiently.

This repository provides implementations of essential algorithms, including searching, sorting, recursion, and foundational data structures. Each concept is demonstrated in Python, but the principles apply to any programming language. Additionally, the repository is configured for GitHub Codespaces, allowing you to explore and run examples without local setup.

## Topics Covered
- **Data Structures**: Learn about essential data structures that help organize and manipulate data efficiently.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Implement and analyze various techniques for finding elements within a dataset.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Explore different sorting methods, including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Recursion**: Understand how recursive algorithms break down problems into smaller subproblems.
- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Implement mathematical approaches such as the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD).
- **Algorithm Performance**: Analyze time and space complexity to evaluate algorithm efficiency.

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10+
- A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

### Getting Started
#### Option 1: Use GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
You can run all examples directly in a GitHub Codespace without installing anything locally.

#### Option 2: Run Locally
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd programming-foundations-algorithms
   ```
3. Run any script using Python:
   ```sh
   python script_name.py
   ```
